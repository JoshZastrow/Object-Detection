# Object-Detection

Hi, this is a project folder where I develop a Convolutional Neural Network for locating and labeling objects in an image. I work with the PASCAL dataset and a RestNet base model to inherit pretrained weights, then I train a fully connected top layer network to both generate bounding box coordinates and labels for objects in an image.
